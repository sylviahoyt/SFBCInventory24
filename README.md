# SFBCInventory24
A volunteer project I completed for the San Francisco Bike Coalition in 2024 


Dear SFBC Person, 

Here’s how the inventory system works: 

1) New inventory comes in or an order is placed, so an inventory minder adds or removes an item from the inventory and logs it in this Google Form: Inventory Tending Form. This Form is the only mechanism by which the inventory can be changed. All other files are view only!
2) The Inventory Tending Form entries create a log that is in this spreadsheet: Inventory Tending Form (Responses).
3) A piece of code (Google Apps Script) within the Inventory Tending Form (Responses) spreadsheet runs whenever the form is submitted. This form finds the entry and its corresponding item in the 2024 Inventory for SFBC spreadsheet. Note that the final column in the Inventory
4) Tending Form (Responses) is a verification that the entry has been logged in the 2024 Inventory for SFBC spreadsheet.
5) The inventory minder can view the current inventory of all the merchandise items in the 2024 Inventory for SFBC spreadsheet. 

This inventory system was built by Sylvia in February 2024. The files live in her Google Drive, and SFBC Staff have all editing permissions. The Google Apps Script is visible on Sylvia’s GitHub. 

Reach me for any questions, comments, or suggestions. 

See you in the bike lane! 
Sylvia
